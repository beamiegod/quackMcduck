<h2>be a supporter! Vote me and do the right thing, the right thing for all of us</h2>
<main>
<p>Over all these years, have you noticed, our country is falling apart!Our current and previous Prime Ministers have been slowly failing to keep us big.All of that could change, vote me and i will keep us ontop, you will not have the need to worry about brexit, your job, if your salary's going down, if another war is coming, because you are safe, you are high and you are great.</p>
<p>If you ever consider to vote for me, i will try my hardest to;
  1.)Try to make the community more tolerant to express who we are,
  2.)Make schools lunches cheaper-or possibly eliminate the money program-,
  3.)Make this a safer place for all countries,
  4.)make sure you and your diverse beliefs are heard.</p>
